## Petittube
From wikipedia:
> Petit Tube is a French website that searches through an algorithm for obscure YouTube videos and displays them on the website, cycling through content to display and allowing people to view videos that would have otherwise been seen by few people. The website was launched in 2011. Its founder is Yann van der Cruyssen, a French digital artist.
## Issues
It's possible it might not work in the future due to changes in the website. If this happens, create an issue and I'll fix it.
